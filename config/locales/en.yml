      overview: "Clinical trials are an important treatment option for cancer
        patients of all ages. Clinical trials can offer patients the most
        cutting-edge treatment, and can help bring new therapies to market.
        National Brain Tumor Society's Clinical Trial Connector is an online
        tool to help patients find clinical trials that are right for them. You
        can browse brain tumor trials and filter these based on medical history,
        location, and age. Coming soon - you will be able to register so that
        you can keep informed of trials opening in your area. Also, visit the
        Clinical Trial Blog for updates on existing trials and the openings of
        new trials."
