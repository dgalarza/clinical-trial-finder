      purpose: "The purpose of a clinical trial is to determine the most
        effective and safest treatment for a disease. Clinical trial evaluation
        is a key step to translating research into new medicines that can provide
        better outcomes for patients. The performance of clinical trials is a
        vital component of U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s drug approval process,
        without which advances in therapeutics for brain tumor patients would not
        be possible. Often the lengthiest aspect of the drug approval process is
        finding people to participate in trials. The NBTS Clinical Trial Finder
        is intended to help raise awareness and increase participation in clinical
        trials to facilitate brain tumor research and accelerate the development
        of new drugs and treatments for patients."
