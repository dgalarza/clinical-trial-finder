        particular needs, please fill out the filter questions below. As a result
        of your search and after reviewing the details, if you are interested in
        learning more about a trial, identify the trial site nearest to your
        location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone. We also
        strongly recommend that you consult with your healthcare provider about
        the trials that may interest you."
      purpose: "The purpose of a clinical trial is to determine the most
        effective and safest treatment for a disease. Clinical trial evaluation
        is a key step to translating research into new medicines that can provide
        better outcomes for patients. The performance of clinical trials is a
        vital component of U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s drug approval process,
        without which advances in therapeutics for brain tumor patients would not
        be possible. Often the lengthiest aspect of the drug approval process is
        finding people to participate in trials. The NBTS Clinical Trial Finder
        is intended to help raise awareness and increase participation in clinical
        trials to facilitate brain tumor research and accelerate the development
        of new drugs and treatments for patients."
