    <p>The purpose of a clinical trial is to determine the most effective and safest treatment for a disease. Clinical trial evaluation is a key step to translating research into new medicines that can provide better outcomes for patients. The performance of clinical trials is a vital component of U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s drug approval process, without which advances in therapeutics for brain tumor patients would not be possible. Often the lengthiest aspect of the drug approval process is finding people to participate in trials. The NBTS Clinical Trial Finder is intended to help raise awareness and increase participation in clinical trials to facilitate brain tumor research and accelerate the development of new drugs and treatments for patients.</p>
